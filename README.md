## Contributions
- For style related values please add the new value to the corresponding file inside [Styles folder](./lib/styles)
- [Provider package](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) is used for sharing data between widgets. Please take a look before any contribution
- Always keep your widgets small
- Don't be afraid to use inheritence when needed but also keep in mind that the best practice is to re use widgets instead of extending a widget:
  - [BetActions.dart](./lib/widgets/BetCard/BetActions.dart) (abstract class)
  - [BetSlidable.dart](./lib/widgets/BetCard/BetSlidable.dart)
  - [BetActionButtons.dart](./lib/widgets/BetCard/BetActionButtons.dart)
